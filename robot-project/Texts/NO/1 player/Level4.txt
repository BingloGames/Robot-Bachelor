A variable is a name we give to a value so we can use it in other parts of the code, like functions.

This is a variable:         X = 1  
This is another variable:   Y = 2

To call a variable you just write the variable name, like this: X. 

To change the value of a variable, you would do it like this: X = 3, or X = X + Y.
