Lists are also used to store values, like Variables, but while you can only store one value in each Variable, a List can have more than one value. The values dont have to be the same type. For example:
	List = [1, 2.5, "text"]   		is a valid list, with 3 values, one int, one float and one str. 
To call the first value, you call the list and the index number. To call the first value of our list, we would do:
	List[0]  this would give you the value 1 . 
Remember that python always starts counting from 0, so the indexes for List would be: 0, 1, 2 .

Find the list and use the correct index to answer the question and open the door.
