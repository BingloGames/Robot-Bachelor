Sometimes, you will want to do the same action over and over, for example, walking forward 5 times. For this we use a For loop, like this:
	For i in range(5):
		Forward()
In this case the For loop uses the variable i = 0, and in each loop it increases i by 1, until it reaches 4, from 0 to 4 we have 5 runs. Remember that python always starts at 0. The loop will run only the lines that are indented. 

Try using For loops to reach the end using only 12 lines of code.
